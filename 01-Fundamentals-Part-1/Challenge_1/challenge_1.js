// CHALLENGE #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

// Your task is to write some code to help them:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.

// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.

// 3.  Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

// 4.  BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too

// TEST DATA: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

// ðŸ‘‹ OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture

// IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).

/* Write your code below. Good luck! ðŸ™‚ */

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log(BMIMark);
console.log(BMIJohn);

const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(markHigherBMI);
